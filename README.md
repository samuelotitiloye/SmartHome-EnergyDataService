SmartHome EnergyDataService

EnergyDataService is a production-grade .NET 8 microservice responsible for managing smart-home IoT devices, including registration, updates, queries, filtering, pagination, and health visibility.
It is built using Clean Architecture, CQRS/MediatR, EF Core, Redis caching, OpenTelemetry, Serilog, and a full Docker Compose observability stack.

This service is part of the larger SmartHome Platform (EnergyDataService → EnergyDataService → AlertService).

Request Flow (High-Level)
Client
  → API Endpoint
    → MediatR Command/Query
      → Validation Pipeline
      → Handler Executes
         → Repository → PostgreSQL
         → Redis Cache (Reads/Writes)
  → Response returned
  → OpenTelemetry sends metrics + traces

Detailed Request Flow:
 - Minimal API → MediatR → Handler → DB/Cache

All tests run in CI via GitHub Actions.

## Observability

DeviceService ships with full observability using OpenTelemetry, providing metrics, dashboards, and distributed tracing out of the box.

### Prometheus — Metrics
http://localhost:9090

Scrapes and stores service metrics including:
- Request rate (RPS)
- API latency (p90 / p99)
- Error counts
- Runtime & GC metrics

### Grafana — Dashboards
http://localhost:3000  
Login: `admin / admin`

Includes custom dashboards for:
- API throughput
- Latency (p90 / p99)
- Error rate (handles zero-error traffic correctly)
- Health & readiness signals

### Jaeger — Distributed Tracing
http://localhost:16686

Provides:
- End-to-end request tracing
- MediatR handler execution spans
- Database and Redis dependency spans


Example API Requests (cURL):
 - Here are sample cURL commands demonstrating the core device workflows.
Register a Device
 ```
 curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/devices/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Kitchen Sensor",
    "type": "sensor",
    "location": "Kitchen",
    "isOnline": true,
    "thresholdWatts": 50,
    "serialNumber": "ABC12345"
  }'
```
Get Device by ID

`curl http://localhost:8080/api/devices/<deviceId>`

Update A Device
```
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/devices/<deviceId> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Kitchen Sensor v2",
    "type": "sensor",
    "location": "Kitchen",
    "isOnline": false,
    "thresholdWatts": 45,
    "serialNumber": "ABC12345"
  }'
```

List Devices (with pagination + filters)
`curl "http://localhost:8080/api/devices?page=1&pageSize=10&nameContains=sensor&location=Kitchen"`

Delete A Device
`curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/devices/<deviceId>`

Health Check
`curl http://localhost:8080/health`

Prometheus Metrics
`curl http://localhost:8080/metrics`

Redis Connectivity Test (via container)
`docker exec -it redis redis-cli ping`

Performance Notes:
- Redis caching significantly reduces load on GET /api/devices/{id}.
- Pagination protects the DB by limiting large reads.
- Global rate limiting prevents noisy clients from overwhelming the API.
- Response caching enabled for specific endpoints.
- EF Core NoTracking improves performance for read-only queries.
- Bulk operations optimized via batch inserts/updates where applicable.

Future Expansion:
EnergyDataService (next microservice)
- Receives device energy consumption events
- Computes real-time usage metrics
- Integrates with EnergyDataService through device IDs
- Long-term: energy anomaly detection

AlertService
- Monitors offline/high-wattage devices
- Sends alerts via SNS/email/webhooks
- Uses Redis or DynamoDB for alert state tracking

Both services will use the same Clean Architecture, observability stack, and infrastructure patterns.


For Recruiters & Interviewers
This repository showcases ability to build production-grade backend services with modern engineering practices:

Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Clean Architecture with strict layering
- CQRS + MediatR for maintainability and separation of concerns
- Redis caching for performance optimization
- Resilient API design with rate limiting & response caching
- Comprehensive OpenTelemetry instrumentation (metrics + traces)
- Containerized local environment (PostgreSQL, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
- Full unit test suite for business logic and handlers
- Developer-friendly documentation and examples

Why This Project Stands Out:
This service mirrors patterns used in cloud-native companies and platform engineering teams:
- Observable
- Testable
- Scalable
- Containerized
- Portable

It also demonstrates the ability to:
- Work iteratively using sprint-based development
- Produce clear documentation
- Write clean, maintainable C# and .NET 8 code
- Think like a backend engineer and DevOps engineer

What to Look At:
`/EnergyDataService.Api` for minimal APIs, rate limiting, and OTel setup
`/EnergyDataService.Application` for commands, queries, handlers, and validations
`/EnergyDataService.Infrastructure` for EF Core, caching, and repository patterns
`/EnergyDataService.Tests` for modular unit test design
`docker-compose.yml` for local cloud-style environment
Grafana dashboards + Prometheus metrics via the observability stack
